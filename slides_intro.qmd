# 1. Introduction {.smaller .scrollable}

- Sentiment Analysis:
  - Defined as a branch of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that focuses on the computational treatment of opinions, sentiments, and subjectivity in digital text [@MEDHAT20141093].

## 1.1 Sentiment Analysis {.smaller .scrollable}

- Importance of Sentiment Analysis:
  - Essential for understanding public opinion, aiding businesses in refining marketing strategies, improving products, and enhancing customer satisfaction.
  - The rise of social media and e-commerce platforms has increased the importance of sentiment analysis for real-time consumer behavior insights.

- Case Study: Twitter Data:
  - Hasan, Maliha, and Arifuzzaman (2019) used Twitter data to demonstrate the potential of sentiment analysis.
  - Their methodology combined Bag of Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) models with logistic regression, achieving an accuracy of 85.25% in classifying tweets as positive or negative [@9036670].

- Case Study: E-commerce Reviews:
  - Kathuria, Sethi, and Negi (2022) applied sentiment analysis to e-commerce reviews using various machine learning models (logistic regression, AdaBoost, SVM, Naive Bayes, and random forest).
  - Analyzed the Womenâ€™s E-commerce Clothing Reviews dataset to understand consumer behavior and the impact of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) on customer attitudes and product sales [@10093674].

- Granular Approach:
  - Nasukawa and Yi (2003) focused on extracting sentiments linked to specific subjects rather than entire documents.
  - Their prototype system used a syntactic parser and sentiment lexicon to detect sentiments in web pages and news articles, offering detailed insights into specific opinions [@nasukawa2003sentiment].

- Conclusion:
  - These studies illustrate the evolution and application of sentiment analysis using NLP, highlighting its critical role in extracting insights from vast amounts of text data for strategic decision-making.

## 1.2 Vector Embeddings In Natural Language Processing {.smaller}

- Introduction to Embeddings:
  - Vector embeddings are crucial for encoding or describing the sentiment of words or groups of words.
  - Embeddings improve upon representing words as indices in a vocabulary by encoding relationships or similarities between words [@camacho2020embeddings].

- Advantages of Embeddings:
  - Unlike simple vocabulary indices, embeddings can represent multiple meanings of words and their semantic and syntactic patterns [@pennington2014glove].
  - Example: In the Word2Vec model, vector arithmetic can evaluate analogies (e.g., "king" - "man" + "woman" = "queen")[@mikolov2013word2vec].

---

<div class="smaller">
- Advanced Embedding Models:
  - Sentence embeddings build on word embeddings to represent sentences, improving over Bag of Words models, which have high dimensionality and sparseness issues[@pilehvar2020embeddings].
  - Document embeddings further extend this concept to encode entire documents for NLP tasks where word ordering is important[@pilehvar2020embeddings].

## 1.3 Using Embeddings For Sentiment Analysis {.smaller}

- Performance Improvement:
  - Word embedding and deep learning models have significantly enhanced NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis [@10255396].
  - Popular methods include Word2Vec and Global Vectors (GloVe), trained on different datasets (Google News and Wikipedia 2014, respectively) [@10543279].

- Challenges with Pre-trained Embeddings:
  - Pre-trained word embeddings often fail to capture contextual sentiment information, leading to inaccuracies (e.g., mapping "good" and "bad" to neighboring vectors) [@9397340][@7296633].
  - The paper aims to explore these challenges and investigate alternative embedding methods for more accurate sentiment analysis.
