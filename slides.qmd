# 1. Introduction {.smaller .scrollable}

- Sentiment Analysis:
  - Defined as a branch of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that focuses on the computational treatment of opinions, sentiments, and subjectivity in digital text [@MEDHAT20141093].

---

## 1.1 Sentiment Analysis {.smaller .scrollable}

- Importance of Sentiment Analysis:
  - Essential for understanding public opinion, aiding businesses in refining marketing strategies, improving products, and enhancing customer satisfaction.
  - The rise of social media and e-commerce platforms has increased the importance of sentiment analysis for real-time consumer behavior insights.

- Case Study: Twitter Data:
  - Hasan, Maliha, and Arifuzzaman (2019) used Twitter data to demonstrate the potential of sentiment analysis.
  - Their methodology combined Bag of Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) models with logistic regression, achieving an accuracy of 85.25% in classifying tweets as positive or negative [@9036670].

---

<div class="smaller">
- Case Study: E-commerce Reviews:
  - Kathuria, Sethi, and Negi (2022) applied sentiment analysis to e-commerce reviews using various machine learning models (logistic regression, AdaBoost, SVM, Naive Bayes, and random forest).
  - Analyzed the Women’s E-commerce Clothing Reviews dataset to understand consumer behavior and the impact of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) on customer attitudes and product sales [@10093674].

- Granular Approach:
  - Nasukawa and Yi (2003) focused on extracting sentiments linked to specific subjects rather than entire documents.
  - Their prototype system used a syntactic parser and sentiment lexicon to detect sentiments in web pages and news articles, offering detailed insights into specific opinions [@nasukawa2003sentiment].

## 1.2 Vector Embeddings In Natural Language Processing {.smaller}

- Introduction to Embeddings:
  - Vector embeddings are crucial for encoding or describing the sentiment of words or groups of words.
  - Embeddings improve upon representing words as indices in a vocabulary by encoding relationships or similarities between words [@camacho2020embeddings].

- Advantages of Embeddings:
  - Unlike simple vocabulary indices, embeddings can represent multiple meanings of words and their semantic and syntactic patterns [@pennington2014glove].
  - Example: In the Word2Vec model, vector arithmetic can evaluate analogies (e.g., "king" - "man" + "woman" = "queen")[@mikolov2013word2vec].

---

<div class="smaller">
- Advanced Embedding Models:
  - Sentence embeddings build on word embeddings to represent sentences, improving over Bag of Words models, which have high dimensionality and sparseness issues[@pilehvar2020embeddings].
  - Document embeddings further extend this concept to encode entire documents for NLP tasks where word ordering is important[@pilehvar2020embeddings].
</div>

## 1.3 Using Embeddings For Sentiment Analysis {.smaller}

- Performance Improvement:
  - Word embedding and deep learning models have significantly enhanced NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis [@10255396].
  - Popular methods include Word2Vec and Global Vectors (GloVe), trained on different datasets (Google News and Wikipedia 2014, respectively) [@10543279].

- Challenges with Pre-trained Embeddings:
  - Pre-trained word embeddings often fail to capture contextual sentiment information, leading to inaccuracies (e.g., mapping "good" and "bad" to neighboring vectors) [@9397340][@7296633].
  - The paper aims to explore these challenges and investigate alternative embedding methods for more accurate sentiment analysis.

# Methods

## What is a neural Network?
- A neural network is a type of algorithm that mimics the structure and function 
of the human brain. Their goal is to create an artificial system that can process
and analyze data in a similar way.
- There are different types of neural networks but there are some common elements
between most of them. Those elements are:
  - Artificial Neurons
  - Layers

## Neural Network Layers {.smaller}
- Neural networks usually have three types of layers:
  - Input Layer
  - Hidden layers
  - Output layer
  
![](nnLayers.png){fig-align="center"}

## What are embeddings? {.smaller}
- Embeddings are a technique that allow us to map words or phrases into a corresponding
vector of real numbers, where the position and direction of the vector capture the word's
semantic meaning in relation to other words. 
- They make high-dimensional data like words readable
to our algorithm/model and allows our model to recognize and learn meaningful relationships 
and similarities between words

## Dense Layer & Cosine Similarity {.smaller}
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Cosine Similarity
  - Measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors, providing a measure of similarity.
  - The smaller the angle the higher the similarity between the two vectors.
  - $cosine\_similarity(u,v) = \frac{u.v}{||u|| ||v||}$
![](cosine.jpg){fig-align="center"}
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Dense Layer
  - A logistic regression model with a sigmoid activation function used for binary classification. 
  - It outputs the probability that the input belongs to a positive class.
  - $y=\sigma(W⋅z+b)$
  - Where:
     - z is the flattened input vector.
     - W is the weight vector.
     - b is the bias term.
     - $\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$ is the sigmoid function.

## Sentiment Analysis
- Through the use of a neural network and it's hidden layers (embedding & dense), and the cosine similarity we are able to take inputs
and classify them as being part of a positive or negative class based on what our model has learned from our training dataset.

## 3. Analysis and Results
### 3.1 Dataset Description
For sentiment analysis, this project will use a data set of movie reviews from IMDB [@ImdbDataset]. The dataset includes 25,000 movie reviews, and since some movies are reviewed more often than others, the dataset includes a maximum of 30 reviews for any particular movie. The dataset includes only the top 5,000 most frequent words, however the top 50 most frequent words are also discarded as they are unlikely to contribute much to sentiment context. IMDB reviews include a star rating of 1 to 10 stars, and these ratings have been converted to a 0-1 scale for use as a sentiment classification label in the dataset. 

The TensorFlow package [@tensorflow2015] includes this dataset in a vectorized format which is ideal for use in neural networks. The vectorization process starts by assigning each word that appears in the vocabularly (i.e. all the unique words in the dataset) with a unique number for a numeric substitution value. Then each word in the original text observation is replaced with the substitution number assigned to that word. Every observation is translated in this same way to convert from a string made up of words to a vector of integers. An example follows below:

Observation #1: "this is fun"

Observation #2: "fun times ahead"

Observation #3: "fun is ahead of times"

Based on the three above observations, there are six unique words in the vocabularly. These six unique words would each be assigned a numeric value. Thus the vocabulary list would be [1-this, 2-is, 3-fun, 4-times, 5-ahead, 6-of]. To vectorize the strings, the numeric values for each of those words are added to a integer vector. The vectorized observations are shown below.

Observation #1 vectorized: [1,2,3]

Observation #2 vectorized: [3,4,5]

Observation #3 vectorized: [3,2,5,6,4]

#### Loading and preparing Training and Test Data

Load the tensorflow IMDB review dataset. Only the top most common 5000 words will be included. All other words will be replaced with a token representing an unknown word. Up to the first 500 words in a review are included in the training and test sets.

The neural network will be expecting batches of training examples that are 500 words long, so pad any observations shorter than 500 words with a token representing the padding word to get to the required 500 word length.

```{r}
max_vocab_words <- 5000
max_words <- 500

imdb <- dataset_imdb(num_words = max_vocab_words)
imdb_train_x = imdb$train$x
imdb_test_x = imdb$test$x
imdb_train_y = imdb$train$y
imdb_test_y = imdb$test$y

imdb_train_x <- pad_sequences(imdb_train_x, maxlen = max_words)
imdb_test_x <- pad_sequences(imdb_test_x, maxlen = max_words)
```

### Statistical Modeling

In this section a neural network model will be implemented using the keras package to learn embeddings for each of the words in the vocabulary. The goal is to learn multi-dimensional vectors where similar words are close in the vector-space, where similar means having a similar contextual meaning with regards to the training dataset and its sentiment classification. For example, "gem" and "favorite" would be highly similar in the context of a movie review, whereas in a general context they would not be so similar.

The number of dimensions of the output embedding will be varied and tested as part of the modeling process. The number of dimensions is an important hyperparameter since it will control how much compression of the training set occurs. A small number of dimensions results in a higher amount of compression, whereas a large number of dimensions allows for more detail to be captured by the embeddings. However, a larger number of dimensions can also lead to overfitting [@yin2018dimensionality]. 

Next the embedding model is trained. [@DeepLearningRBook] and [@Monroe] were important resources in coding the embedding training. As a first step, the model will be trained repeatedly with a different number of dimensions each time. Models will be trained using from 2 to 7 dimensions, and the testing accuracy will be recorded for each model.

The neural network model uses an embedding layer that will convert the words in the vocabulary to a multi-dimensional vector embedding once trained. The number of inputs to the embedding layer is 5000, which corresponds to the number of words in the vocabulary. The selected number of outputs for the embedding layer is the dimensionality of the embedding vector. As mentioned previously, this dimensionality will be varried to test the performance of the embeddings across different sizes of embedding dimensions. A second layer in the neural network model flattens the 3 dimensional tensor output from the embedding layer to a 2 dimensional tensor. Finally, a dense layer connects every output from the flatten layer to the final output layer. The model is trained using back propagation to predict the sentiment classification variable, and the final trained weights of the embedding layer are the embeddings for each corresponding word in the vocabulary.

```{r}
set.seed(3)
reticulate::py_run_string("import random; random.seed(3)")
reticulate::py_run_string("import keras; keras.utils.set_random_seed(3)")

max_vector_dimensions <- 7
accuracy_by_dimensions <- c()
for (num_dims in rep(2:max_vector_dimensions)) {
  imdb_embedding_model <- keras_model_sequential() %>%
    layer_embedding(input_dim = max_vocab_words, output_dim = num_dims) %>%
    layer_flatten() %>%
    layer_dense(units = 1, activation = "sigmoid")
  
  imdb_embedding_model %>% compile(
    optimizer = "rmsprop",
    loss = "binary_crossentropy",
    metrics = c("acc")
  )
  
  imdb_embedding_history <- imdb_embedding_model %>% keras3::fit(
    imdb_train_x, imdb_train_y, verbose=0,
    epochs = 6,
    batch_size = 32,
    validation_split = 0.2
  )
  
  imdb_embedding_results <- imdb_embedding_model %>% evaluate(imdb_test_x, imdb_test_y)
  accuracy_by_dimensions = c(accuracy_by_dimensions, imdb_embedding_results[["acc"]])
}
names(accuracy_by_dimensions) <- rep(2:max_vector_dimensions)
accuracy_by_dimensions
```
Surprisingly, an embedding of just 2 dimensions had the best accuracy. That may be the highest accuracy in predicting the binary sentiment classification, but the question is does that over compress the data and fail to represent the higher order patterns we hope the embedding models? As [@yin2018dimensionality] points out, "the impact of dimensionality on word embedding has not yet been fully understood...a word embedding with a small dimensionality is typically not expressive enough to capture all possible word relations, whereas one with a very large dimensionality suffers from over-fitting." 

The model with just 2 dimensions is tested to see how well it does on finding similar words, where similar is in the context of the sentiment of a movie review.

```{r}
best_num_dimensions = 2

imdb_embedding_model <- keras_model_sequential() %>%
  layer_embedding(input_dim = max_vocab_words, output_dim = best_num_dimensions) %>%
  layer_flatten() %>%
  layer_dense(units = 1, activation = "sigmoid")

imdb_embedding_model %>% compile(
  optimizer = "rmsprop",
  loss = "binary_crossentropy",
  metrics = c("acc")
)

imdb_embedding_history <- imdb_embedding_model %>% keras3::fit(
  imdb_train_x, imdb_train_y, verbose=0,
  epochs = 6,
  batch_size = 32,
  validation_split = 0.2
)
  
imdb_embedding_results <- imdb_embedding_model %>% evaluate(imdb_test_x, imdb_test_y)

# Get the weights from layer 1, the embedding layer. This is
# the list of embedding vectors.
embedding_weights <- get_weights(imdb_embedding_model)[[1]] 

# add labels for the word represented by each embedding
imdb_word_index = dataset_imdb_word_index()
reverse_word_index <- names(imdb_word_index)
names(reverse_word_index) <- imdb_word_index
top_words <- reverse_word_index[as.character(1:max_vocab_words)]
rownames(embedding_weights) = c("*","*","*","*", top_words[1:(max_vocab_words-4)])

# create a function to find embeddings that are close to the desired 
# word, using cosine similarity to determine closeness
close_embeddings <- function(search_word, embeddings) {
  result <- embeddings[search_word, , drop=FALSE] %>% sim2(embeddings, y=., method="cosine")
  result[,1] %>% sort(decreasing=TRUE) %>% head(n=6)
}
```

The words "awful", "mediocre", "perfect" and "favorite" are some positive and negative words that could be found in a movie review. These test words are ysed to qualitatively test the embedding model by examining which words are found to be close to the test words.

```{r}
close_embeddings("awful", embedding_weights)
close_embeddings("mediocre", embedding_weights)
close_embeddings("perfect", embedding_weights)
close_embeddings("favorite", embedding_weights)
```
Some related words are found, but there are some other words that don't seem to be very related. Overall the results don't appear very good, so it seems embeddings using only 2 dimensions is not adequate despite the high accuracy found on the test set.

[@yin2018dimensionality] states that selecting the number of dimensions is often done ad hoc or by using grid search, with a common method being to train embeddings of different dimensions and evaluate them models using a functionality test like word analogy. A similar method was used here on a smaller scale where the embedding model was retrained using a larger number of dimensions and the performance of the related words test was compared. There was insufficient time to test many model variations, but it was important to test a larger number of dimensions to compare to the 2 dimension model. The test accuracy for the model previously trained with 7 dimensions was fairly close to the accuracy for 2 dimensions, so that embedding length was tested next.

```{r}
best_num_dimensions = 7

imdb_embedding_model <- keras_model_sequential() %>%
  layer_embedding(input_dim = max_vocab_words, output_dim = best_num_dimensions) %>%
  layer_flatten() %>%
  layer_dense(units = 1, activation = "sigmoid")

imdb_embedding_model %>% compile(
  optimizer = "rmsprop",
  loss = "binary_crossentropy",
  metrics = c("acc")
)

imdb_embedding_history <- imdb_embedding_model %>% keras3::fit(
  imdb_train_x, imdb_train_y, verbose=0,
  epochs = 6,
  batch_size = 32,
  validation_split = 0.2
)
  
imdb_embedding_results <- imdb_embedding_model %>% evaluate(imdb_test_x, imdb_test_y)
```

Here are the similar words for the same positive and negative words that were previously tested, but now tested using the new embedding model with higher dimensionality:

```{r}
embedding_weights <- get_weights(imdb_embedding_model)[[1]] 
rownames(embedding_weights) = c("*","*","*","*", top_words[1:(max_vocab_words-4)])

close_embeddings("awful", embedding_weights)
close_embeddings("mediocre", embedding_weights)
close_embeddings("perfect", embedding_weights)
close_embeddings("favorite", embedding_weights)
```
These results are better than the 2 dimension model, so it seems test accuracy isn't a good method to determine how many dimensions should be included in the embedding model.

Next, the number of epochs used in training will be evaluated to see how that impacts the model performance.

```{r}
# Now that we know how many dimensions gives the greatest accuracy, find the number of epochs so model doesn't overfit
set.seed(42)
reticulate::py_run_string("import random; random.seed(42)")
reticulate::py_run_string("import keras; keras.utils.set_random_seed(42)")

imdb_embedding_model <- keras_model_sequential() %>%
  layer_embedding(input_dim = max_vocab_words, output_dim = best_num_dimensions) %>%
  layer_flatten() %>%
  layer_dense(units = 1, activation = "sigmoid")

imdb_embedding_model %>% compile(
  optimizer = "rmsprop",
  loss = "binary_crossentropy",
  metrics = c("acc")
)

imdb_embedding_history <- imdb_embedding_model %>% keras3::fit(
  imdb_train_x, imdb_train_y, verbose=0,
  epochs = 10,
  batch_size = 32,
  validation_split = 0.2
)
  
imdb_embedding_results <- imdb_embedding_model %>% evaluate(imdb_test_x, imdb_test_y)
```

![Training Metrics](training_plot.png)
This keras graph of the accuracy of the training data (blue) vs. the testing data (green) shows that the testing accuracy starts to flatten at epoch 6, so it appears 6 epochs is effective. This is the number of epochs previously used in training, so the best model remains 7 dimensions trained with 6 epochs.

      theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5, size = 14))
```


### Conclusion
The development and analysis of the word embedding model for classifying IMDB movie reviews demonstrated promising results. The optimal number of embedding dimensions was identified as 7, achieving an accuracy of 87.34% on the test dataset. This was determined through extensive experimentation, revealing that higher dimensions, such as 7, provided competitive and consistent accuracy. The model's performance is noteworthy, given the constraints of training on only the top 5000 most common words, minimal data preprocessing, and limiting input sequences to the first 500 words of each review. These factors illustrate the model's robustness and effectiveness in capturing the semantic relationships within the data.

Furthermore, the embedding similarity results showed that the model could meaningfully capture semantic relationships, as evidenced by the coherent and relevant similar words found for terms like "awful," "mediocre," "perfect," and "favorite." The final training session, capped at 10 epochs, ensured the model did not overfit, maintaining its accuracy and reliability. Overall, the model's strong performance under constrained conditions highlights its potential for practical applications in sentiment analysis, offering an efficient and effective solution for understanding and categorizing movie reviews.
