abstract = {Summary Deep Learning with R introduces the world of deep learning using the powerful Keras library and its R language interface. The book builds your understanding of deep learning through intuitive explanations and practical examples. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications. About the Technology Machine learning has made remarkable progress in recent years. Deep-learning systems now enable previously impossible smart applications, revolutionizing image recognition and natural-language processing, and identifying complex patterns in data. The Keras deep-learning library provides data scientists and developers working in R a state-of-the-art toolset for tackling deep-learning tasks. About the Book Deep Learning with R introduces the world of deep learning using the powerful Keras library and its R language interface. Initially written for Python as Deep Learning with Python by Keras creator and Google AI researcher Franois Chollet and adapted for R by RStudio founder J. J. Allaire, this book builds your understanding of deep learning through intuitive explanations and practical examples. You'll practice your new skills with R-based applications in computer vision, natural-language processing, and generative models. What's Inside Deep learning from first principles Setting up your own deep-learning environment Image classification and generation Deep learning for text and sequences About the Reader You'll need intermediate R programming skills. No previous experience with machine learning or deep learning is assumed. About the Authors Franois Chollet is a deep-learning researcher at Google and the author of the Keras library. J.J. Allaire is the founder of RStudio and the author of the R interfaces to Tensor Flow and Keras.}
